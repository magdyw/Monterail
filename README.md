Why jQuery?

It is enough for this project (at least at points I have done it). It's my very first library for JS I've learned. I feel more confident writting using it. I was not working with someone or planning to expand this project, so I did not have to use other one. Which I would do, if I had to.

Why Bootstrap?

It is pretty useful in this project as long as every element can be implemented using Bootstrap. It was of course quicker for me to implement it that way but I don't mind, or actually prefer, not using frameworks when not needed or with projects that should be customized.

Modal box.

Yes, I know it is possible to make it with HTML and CSS only. But I have never used JS for it before, I wanted to try it this way.

Voting.

I implemented voting system in JS using jQuery library. It works with click on the corresponding triangle, up or down one.

Fonts colors, etc.

Fonts and colors are saved in _fonts.scss and _colors.scss files. Insted of Rotice I used Playfair Display.

Doctor's faces.

I am sorry they are all the same.

I am aware that not all the elements are implemented the way they are presented on the attached pictures. I had problems with few of them. Most differences may be caused by oversight (font, color, etc.. ). Some navigation arrows are replaced by '>'. My main goal was to make this site ready for futher styling.
